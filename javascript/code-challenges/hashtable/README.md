# Hashtables
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Create a Hashtable that contains methods `add`,`get`,`contains`, and `hash`.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create methods to successfully populate a hashtable and test functionality for:

1. Adding a key/value to your hashtable results in the value being in the data structure
2. Retrieving based on a key returns the value stored
3. Successfully returns null for a key that does not exist in the hashtable
4. Successfully handle a collision within the hashtable
5. Successfully retrieve a value from a bucket within the hashtable that has a collision
6. Successfully hash a key to an in-range value


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

Big O for space and time is O(1) because the size is predetermined and the time it takes is cut down when a key is provided to find a value.

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your hashtable -->

`hash()`

`get()`

`contains()`

`set()`
